# Windows Enumeration
The first thing you should do when you gain access to a Windows machine is enumeration.
## Users
A user object, and all of its properties looks like this:
```PowerShell
AccountExpires         :
Description            : Built-in account for guest access to the computer/domain
Enabled                : False
FullName               :
PasswordChangeableDate :
PasswordExpires        :
UserMayChangePassword  : False
PasswordRequired       : False
PasswordLastSet        :
LastLogon              :
Name                   : Guest
SID                    : S-1-5-21-1394777289-3961777894-1791813945-501
PrincipalSource        : Local
ObjectClass            : User
```
### `whoami`
`whoami` is a common command-line tool found on both [Windows](../../computers/windows/README.md) and Linux machines. We can use this to see both the username and the hostname:
```powershell
kali@kali:~$ nc 192.168.50.220 4444
Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.22000.318]
(c) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.

C:\Users\dave>whoami
whoami
clientwk220\dave

C:\Users\dave>
```
As the first command we run, it also *proves we have command execution* as the user `dave`. The hostname is useful because you can use it to *infer what kind of system* you're on. In this case, it's clear we're on a client system and not a server. Sometimes the hostname will also hint at the purpose of the system or what applications are running on it. 
#### `whoami /groups`
We can also use `whoami` to check which groups `dave` is a member of. On windows we give the switch `/groups`:
```powershell
C:\Users\dave> whoami /groups
whoami /groups

GROUP INFORMATION
-----------------

Group Name                             Type             SID                                            Attributes                                        
====================================== ================ ============================================== ==================================================
Everyone                             Well-known group S-1-1-0                                        Mandatory group, Enabled by default, Enabled group
CLIENTWK220\helpdesk                 Alias            S-1-5-21-2309961351-4093026482-2223492918-1008 Mandatory group, Enabled by default, Enabled group
BUILTIN\Remote Desktop Users         Alias            S-1-5-32-555                                   Mandatory group, Enabled by default, Enabled group
BUILTIN\Users                        Alias            S-1-5-32-545                                   Mandatory group, Enabled by default, Enabled group
NT AUTHORITY\BATCH                   Well-known group S-1-5-3                                        Mandatory group, Enabled by default, Enabled group
CONSOLE LOGON                        Well-known group S-1-2-1                                        Mandatory group, Enabled by default, Enabled group
NT AUTHORITY\Authenticated Users     Well-known group S-1-5-11                                       Mandatory group, Enabled by default, Enabled group
... 
```
From this listing we can see that one of the groups `dave` belongs to is the `helpdesk` group. This might mean he has *additional permissions and access* compared to regular users (since he is likely part of the organization's help desk staff). 

`dave` is also a member of `BUILTIN\Remote Desktop Users` which indicates he might be able to connect *via [RDP](../../networking/protocols/RDP.md)* to this system.

The remaining groups are *standard* and non-privileged, like `Everyone` and `BUILTIN\Users`. 
### `net user`
Similar to the cmdlet `Get-LocalUser`.
### `Get-LocalUser`
```PowerShell
Get-LocalUser
Name           Enabled Description
----           ------- -----------
Administrator  True    Built-in account for administering the computer/domain
DefaultAccount False   A user account managed by the system.
duck           True
duck2          True
Guest          False   Built-in account for guest access to the computer/domain
```
Each user has an [SID](../../OSCP/windows-privesc/security-mechanisms/SID.md):
```PowerShell
Get-Localuser | select-object -property side, name
SID                                            Name
---                                            ----
S-1-5-21-1394777289-3961777894-1791813945-500  Administrator
S-1-5-21-1394777289-3961777894-1791813945-503  DefaultAccount
S-1-5-21-1394777289-3961777894-1791813945-1008 duck
S-1-5-21-1394777289-3961777894-1791813945-1009 duck2
S-1-5-21-1394777289-3961777894-1791813945-501  Guest
```
#### Example: sorting by `PasswordRequired` property
```PowerShell
get-localuser | where-object -property passwordRequired -like false

Name           Enabled Description
----           ------- -----------
DefaultAccount False   A user account managed by the system.
duck           True
duck2          True
Guest          False   Built-in account for guest access to the computer/domain
```
## Groups
### `net localgroup`
Is one command we can use similar to the [powershell](../../coding/languages/powershell.md) cmdlet `Get-LocalGroup`.
### `Get-LocalGroup`
```PowerShell
Get-localgroup
Name                                Description
----                                -----------

```
### `Get-LocalGroupMember`
`Get-LocalGroupMember` is a powershell cmdlet which we can use to review information *for specific groups*. For example, lets use it to review the `adminteam` and `Administrators` groups and their members:
```powershell
PS C:\Users\dave> Get-LocalGroupMember adminteam
Get-LocalGroupMember adminteam

ObjectClass Name                PrincipalSource
----------- ----                ---------------
User        CLIENTWK220\daveadmin Local 

PS C:\Users\dave> Get-LocalGroupMember Administrators
Get-LocalGroupMember Administrators

ObjectClass Name                      PrincipalSource
----------- ----                      ---------------
User        CLIENTWK220\Administrator Local          
User        CLIENTWK220\daveadmin     Local
User        CLIENTWK220\backupadmin     Local  
User        CLIENTWK220\offsec        Local
```
From this we can see that `daveadmin` is the only member of the `adminteam` group.  Another interesting thing to note is `adminteam` *is not listed in the local `Administrators` group*. From the previous `Get-LocalGroup` listing, we know that members of the `adminteam` group are "are admins to all workstations on the second floor" (per the description). So our current system must not be part of that second floor, but we may be able to use this info later as we move laterally through the network. 

Regarding `Administrators`, we've identified at least two *high value targets*: `daveadmin` and `backupadmin` are both members in the `Administrators` group.
## Network
### `netstat`
[netstat](../../CLI-tools/windows/netstat.md) is a command line tool on both Windows machines which we can use to display active [TCP](../../networking/protocols/TCP.md) connections, listening [ports](../../networking/routing/ports.md), ethernet stats, IP routing tables and stats for both [IPv4 and IPv6](../../networking/OSI/3-network/IP-addresses.md#IPv4%20vs%20IPv6). Without giving any parameters, it lists active TCP connections. But with the parameters `-ano`, we can see all active TCP connections as well as TCP and [UDP](../../networking/protocols/UDP.md) ports (with `-n` disabling name resolution and `-o` showing the process ID for each connection):
```powershell
PS C:\Users\dave> netstat -ano
netstat -ano

Active Connections

...
```
### `route print`
This command will display the [routing-table](../../networking/routing/routing-table.md) which contains *all of the routes* known to the system. We can use the output from `route print` to determine possible *attack vectors* to other systems and networks:
```powershell
PS C:\Users\dave> route print

This output *doesn't reveal any routes to unknown networks*, but it's still a valuable thing to check during penetration tests.
### `ipconfig /all`
`ipconfig` is a command on Windows which you can use to view info about and configure network interfaces on the machine. The `/all` switch will list all of the network interfaces with information pertaining to each:
```powershell
PS C:\Users\dave> ipconfig /all
ipconfig /all

   DNS Servers . . . . . . . . . . . : 8.8.8.8
   NetBIOS over Tcpip. . . . . . . . : Enabled
```
From this output, we've learned a few interesting facts:
- the system does not get leased an [IP address](../../networking/OSI/3-network/IP-addresses.md) from [DHCP](../../networking/protocols/DHCP.md) (it was set manually)
- the DNS server, gateway, and [Subnet Mask](../../PNPT/PEH/networking/subnetting.md#Subnet%20Mask)
- the [MAC address](../../networking/OSI/2-datalink/MAC-addresses.md)
All of this information will be useful if we try to *move laterally* to other systems on the network.
