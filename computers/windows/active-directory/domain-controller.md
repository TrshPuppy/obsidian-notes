# AD Domain Controller
Domain Controllers are physical components running the Windows Server OS within an [Active Directory](computers/windows/active-directory/active-directory.md). Specifically, they're any computer in an AD domain which is running Windows Server w/ Active Directory Domain Services installed.

On the machine running Windows Server, you can make it the *Domain Controller* of your domain by *installing AD DS*. This will *give it the role of Domain Controller*.

By default, a domain controller *stores all the information about the domain it is located in* inside a "domain directory." The DC is, in general, the source of authentication in Windows environments and is used to verify identities in AD (among other things).
