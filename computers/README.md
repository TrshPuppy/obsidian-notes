# Computers
This directory contains notes about computers including computing concepts, how different components work, as well as notes on specific operating systems like Windows and Linux.
## Some Interesting Nuggets:
- Check out the [cryptography](concepts/cryptography/cryptography.md) dir where I keep notes on cryptographic concepts, encryption algorithms, etc..
- [Quantum Computing](../hidden/Sec+/21%%202%20Architecture%20&%20Design/2.8%20Cryptography/quantum%20computing.md) (it's dope)
-  Some info on the Linux [filesystem hierarchy](linux/file-system/filesystem-hierarchy.md) & [processes](linux/linux-processes.md)
-  Lots on computer [memory](memory/memory.md)
-  Windows [active-directory](windows/active-directory/active-directory.md) (eww!)
