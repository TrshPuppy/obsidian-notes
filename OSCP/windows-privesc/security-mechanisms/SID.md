# Security Identifier
Security Identifiers (SIDs) are unique values assigned to entities or "principals" in a [Windows](../../../computers/windows/README.md) environment *which can be authenticated*. For example, users and groups have their own SIDs. SIDs for local accounts and groups are generated using the *LSA (Local Security Authority)*. For [active-directory](../../../computers/windows/active-directory/active-directory.md) domains, users and groups' SIDs are generated by the [domain-controller](../../../computers/windows/active-directory/domain-controller.md).

The SID *cannot be changed* and is generated when the entity *is created*. For access control management, Windows *only uses the SID* to identify a user or group. SIDs are important for privesc because they are necessary for *understanding access tokens*. 
## Format
SIDs are made up of four parts separated by a `-`:
```
S-R-X-Y
```
The above letters are placeholders for each part:
- `S`: SID string
- `R`: Revision - *always set to 1* (the SID is always its initial version)
- `X`: Identifier authority: the authority that *issued the SID*. `5` is the most common values which specifies the *NT Authority* (used for local or domain users/ groups)
- `Y`: Sub authorities (of  identifier authority): Every SID has one or more *sub authorities*. This part includes the *domain identifier* and the *relative identifier* (RID). 
	- Domain Identifier: the SID of the domain (for domain users), the SID of the local machine (for local users), or `32` for built-in principals
	- RID: determines principals like users or groups
The following SID is an example for a local user on a Windows machine:
```
S-1-5-21-1336799502-1441772794-948155058-1001
```
In this example *the RID is `1001`*. The RID *starts at 1000* for all principals on a system, so a value of `1001` indicates this is the *second local user* created on the system.
## Well-known SIDs
SIDS with a RID *under `1000`* are known as "well-known" SIDs. They identify generic and *built-in* users and groups instead of specific users/ groups which were created on the system. Here are some useful well-known SIDs (especially for privesc):
```
S-1-0-0                       Nobody        
S-1-1-0	                      Everybody
S-1-5-11                      Authenticated Users
S-1-5-18                      Local System
S-1-5-domainidentifier-500    Administrator
```
