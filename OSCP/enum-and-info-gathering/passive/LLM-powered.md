# LLM Powered Passive Recon
Using [LLMs](../../../computers/concepts/AI/LLMs.md) for info gathering is tricky because LLMs come w/ limitations and risks. Responses generated by LLMs are *based on patterns* rather than accuracy or facts. So information they generate can be outdated or a complete *hallucination*. It's important to *cross reference* information given by an LLM with factual sources (that were not also generated by an LLM). 

Additionally, LLMs come with security risks. Some are trained on sensitive data which they may disclose inadvertently. They also transmit information they generate for a user *back to their company* meaning any information they generate for you about a target *is transmitted to a third party* which could have legal implications (you've just leaked client data).
## Passive LLM Enumeration

Let's ask ChatGPT for all of the public info it can *generate* about `megacorpone.com`:
