# Staged vs Non-staged Payloads
A payload refers to *the actual code or executable which establishes access (usually via a shell) to the target machine*. There are 2 main types: staged and non-staged.
## Non-staged
A non-staged payload sends the entirety of the shellcode or execution code all at once. This type of payload is *usually larger* than staged payloads. 
## Staged
Staged payloads are sent in stages to the target rather than all at once. Because the code is sent in chunks, non-staged payloads tend to be *less stable*. However, staged can be advantageous because each stage is *smaller* and will be less detectable when sent to the target.
## **BONUS:**
While using [Metasploit](cybersecurity/tools/exploitation/metasploit.md) you can identify a non-staged payload vs a staged one via the path of the payload:
```bash
# Non-staged payload:
windows/meterpreter_reverse_tcp
# Staged payload:
windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
```
