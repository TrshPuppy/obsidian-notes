# Obsidian Notes
## This is a public repo of my notes using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).

### Viewing this Repo:
The best way to view this collection of notes is with the Obsidian desktop app. The app shows connections, links between topics, and other formatting which can't be appreciated in the markdown alone.

> This is how my notes on [Fast Flux](Fast-Flux.md) will look on Obsidian Desktop.

If you prefer to browse my notes w/o the help of Obsidian, just know that some markdown formatting will not make sense and will make the notes harder to read.

This repo is for my organization and reference but can be viewed by the public. Feel free to use these notes for your own reference or education. However, I cannot guarantee their accuracy. Thanks! :)

## P.S. Nested Repos!
Check out the [nested-repos](https://github.com/TrshPuppy/obsidian-notes/tree/main/nested-repos) directory to see sub-folders of my notes which I've contextualized into their own repos!
