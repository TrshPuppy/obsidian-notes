# Multiplexing
A method to combine multiple analog and digital signals into one signal to be trasnmitted through a shared medium.
- Aim: to share a scarce resource (physical transmission medium)
- Example: multiple phone calls being carried using one wire

Once multiplexed, the signal is carried across a communication channel like a cable.
- #multiplexing divides the capacity of the communication channel (cable) into several logical channels (one for each message/signal)
- done by a #multiplexer

## #demultiplexing:
A process to extract the original channels on the receiving end
- done by a #demultiplexer

## #inverse-multiplexing:
The opposite of #multiplexing 
- break one stream of data into several streams and transfer them simultaneously over several channels, then recreating the original data stream.
