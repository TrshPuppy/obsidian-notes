# Networking Hubs
Hubs are layer one devices which recieve data from one device and broadcast it to all other devices which are connected to it. 
## Use
The purpose of a hub is to provide a central point for connecting devices on a network. Hubs are considered 'dumb' meaning they have no ability to filter or forward data based on addressing like [MAC](../2-datalink/MAC-addresses.md) and [IP](../3-network/IP-addresses.md).
