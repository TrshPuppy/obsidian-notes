# Internet Message Access Protocol
Protocol for [email](../email.md) which is responsible for transferring email b/w a client and a mail server.
## Process:
Emails are stored on the server and can be *downloaded to multiple devices*.  Sent messages stored on the server and can be synced across multiple devices.
## Security
If you use *Secure IMAP*, you're basically adding [SSL](SSL.md) to the IMAP protocol to [encrypt](../../computers/concepts/cryptography/asymmetric-encryption.md) email traffic.
