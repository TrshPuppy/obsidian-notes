# Internet Control Message Protocol
A protocol used between routers and other network ([layer 3](/networking/OSI/network-layer.md)) devices to communicate operational state and/ or error messages. This protocol is *not used to exchange data between devices* like other IP protocols. Instead, it is meant to communicate the availability of a requested host or service. 

## [Ping Command](/CLI-tools/ping.md):
The `ping` command can be used on both Linux and Windows systems to see whether a connection to a resource via the network is possible.
