# Wifi Authentication
There are two primary kinds of authentication used in Wifi networks:
- **Open System Authentication**: does not require a shared secret/ key/ or credentials. Usually used in *open networks* where no password is needed and allows *any device to connect* w/o verification
- **Shared Key Authentication**: Involves a shared key - both the client and access point verify each other by computing a *challenge-response* based mechanism based on the pre-shared key. This includes WEP, WPA, and [802.11](802.11.md)/ WPA2
