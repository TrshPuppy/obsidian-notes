# Python Tuples:
Tuples are structures in python which are similar to lists but *are immutable.* They also differ in that they use `()` instead of `[]`.
```python
fruits = ("apples", "oranges", "kiwis")
```

## Accessing a Tuple:
To access an element in a tuple, you use bracket notation, just like lists:
```python
print(f"It's like comparing ${fruits[0]} to ${fruits[1]}!")
# output:
It's like comparing apples to oranges!
```
