# Radio Frequency

## Basic Premise
A transmitter, which has a power source, completes a circuit of electricity. When the circuit is closed/ completed, the circuit creates an electromagnetic force which can be picked up by the receiver.

Radios and other devices use sine waves to transmit data. A receiver can distinguish different channels of information by frequency (number of cycles in the sine wave per second)

Every radio has 3 parts:
- *Transmitter*: Takes a stream of data and encodes it into a sine wave. Can then be amplified and sent out.
- *Receiver*: Receives the sine waves and decodes them back into readable data.
- *Antennae*: Used by both the transmitter and receiver
## Creating a sine-wave
### Capacitor 
A capacitor stores electrical energy in an electric field. It does so by accumulating electrons on two surfaces (*terminals*) which are near each other but insulated from one another. Similar to a battery: each terminal holds an opposite charge, which creates an electric-field.

A capacitor can be charged by a battery. As electrons from the battery flow through the capacitor, the negative terminal gains electrons and the positive terminal loses electrons until they reach an *equilibrium*.
#### Capacitance
When the capacitor is fully charged, it can be used to power something (ex: a motorized pulley). Closing the circuit between the capacitor and the motor allows the electrons on the negative terminal to travel to the positive terminal (through the circuit). This releases a lot of energy all at once (faster than attaching the motor to a battery)
### Inductor
An inductor is another way to store energy (ex: electrons). Passing an electric current through a wire will create an electromagnetic-field. If a wire is coiled:
- each coil creates its own EM-field when a current passes through it.
- Due to proximity of the coils, their EM-fields will combine into a larger, more powerful field.

Usually a curled coil in the circuit is used as an inductor. In a circuit, inductors are high-resistance, meaning when a current is going through the circuit, the current will prefer other paths than through the inductor.

Despite being high resistance, some current will flow through the inductor. Over time, as more current goes through the coil, an electromagnetic field builds between the coils. Inductors *store energy in the electromagnetic field they create*.

As the electromagnetic field gets stronger, the resistance of the inductor decreases. Eventually, the resistance is so low that a current can flow through it easily. 

When the EM-field in the coil is at its maximum and the OG power supply is shut off, *the EM-field will collapse and release all of the energy it was storing into the circuit*

**Inductors Don't Like Change**: When a circuit goes from off to on, the current increases, the inductor **opposes this change** (resistance). When the circuit turns off again, and the inductor is charged (has an EM-field). It will release its energy in an opposing force called *back-EMF*
