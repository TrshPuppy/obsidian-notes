[`sqlmap`](https://sqlmap.org/) is a command line tool that automates [SQLi](../injection/SQLi.md).
## Basic Usage
```bash
sqlmap -u http://192.168.50.19/blindsqli.php?user=1 -p user

- `-u` is the target url
- `-p` is the parameter we want to test, in this case `user` (make sure to include the parameter in the url as well, and set its value to a dummy value -- `1` right now)
The output tells us that the parameter seems to be vulnerable to a *[Time Based SQLi](../../../../OSCP/web-apps/SQLi/SQLi.md#Time%20Based%20SQLi)* and then gives us more information for fingerprinting the server.
### Dumping the database
> [!Warning]
> `sqlmap` is loud as hell, and should not be used when you are trying to be evasive or sneaky!

We can also use `sqlmap` to dump the vulnerable database by giving it the `--dump` flag. This tells `sqlmap` to *exploit* the time-based SQLi it discovered. Since it's a time-based attack, it will likely take a while to dump all of the info in the database.
```bash
kali@kali:~$ sqlmap -u http://192.168.50.19/blindsqli.php?user=1 -p user --dump

### Getting a webshell
We can use the `--os-shell` flag to tell `sqlmap` to establish a [web-shell](../web-shell.md). If our target is vulnerable to a UNION attack, and the vulnerable parameter is `item` on the `search` endpoint, then to get a webshell, we can supply `sqlmap` *with a [`POST`](../../../../www/HTTP.md#`POST`) request* saved to a file.
```HTTP
POST /search.php HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.50.19
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:91.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/91.0

item=test
```
If we save this request to a file named `post.txt`, then our `sqlmap` command to get a shell would be:
```bash
sqlmap -r post.txt -p item  --os-shell  --web-root "/var/www/html/tmp"

```
- `-r` tells sqlmap which file to use for the POST request
- `-p` is our vulnerable parameter (`item`)
- `--web-root` tells sqlmap what we expect the web root directory to be on the target machine (`/var/www/html/tmp`)
When we run with `-r`, sqlmap asks us to input the language running on the server, which in this case is [PHP](../../../../coding/languages/PHP.md). Once sqlmap has established the shell, it gives us the `os-shell>` prompt. This is our interactive shell prompt where we can enter commands to be run on the victim host.
### Techniques
To use a specific SQLi technique, use the `--technique` flag. You can test for multiple ones at a time, but the default is set to `--technique=BEUSTQ`
#### [Boolean Based](../injection/SQLi.md#Boolean%20Based)
`--technique=B`
> sqlmap replaces or appends to the affected parameter in the HTTP request, a syntactically valid SQL statement string containing a `SELECT` sub-statement, or any other SQL statement whose the user want to retrieve the output. For each HTTP response, by making a comparison between the HTTP response headers/body with the original request, the tool inference the output of the injected statement character by character. Alternatively, the user can provide a string or regular expression to match on True pages. The bisection algorithm implemented in sqlmap to perform this technique is able to fetch each character of the output with a maximum of seven HTTP requests. Where the output is not within the clear-text plain charset, sqlmap will adapt the algorithm with bigger ranges to detect the output.
#### [Error-based](../injection/SQLi.md#Error-based%20Payloads)
`--technique=E`
> sqlmap replaces or appends to the affected parameter a database-specific error message provoking statement and parses the HTTP response headers and body in search of DBMS error messages containing the injected pre-defined chain of characters and the subquery statement output within. This technique works only when the web application has been configured to disclose back-end database management system error messages.
#### [Time-based](../../../../OSCP/web-apps/SQLi/SQLi.md#Time%20Based%20SQLi)
`--technique=T`
> sqlmap replaces or appends to the affected parameter in the HTTP request, a syntactically valid SQL statement string containing a query which put on hold the back-end DBMS to return for a certain number of seconds. For each HTTP response, by making a comparison between the HTTP response time with the original request, the tool inference the output of the injected statement character by character. Like for boolean-based technique, the bisection algorithm is applied.
#### [UNION Query-based](../injection/UNION-attack.md)
`--technique=U`
> sqlmap appends to the affected parameter a syntactically valid SQL statement starting with an `UNION ALL SELECT`. This technique works when the web application page passes directly the output of the `SELECT` statement within a `for` loop, or similar, so that each line of the query output is printed on the page content. sqlmap is also able to exploit **partial (single entry) UNION query SQL injection** vulnerabilities which occur when the output of the statement is not cycled in a `for` construct, whereas only the first entry of the query output is displayed.
#### Stacked Queries/ "Piggy Backing"
`--technique=S`
> sqlmap tests if the web application supports stacked queries and then, in case it does support, it appends to the affected parameter in the HTTP request, a semi-colon (`;`) followed by the SQL statement to be executed. This technique is useful to run SQL statements other than `SELECT`, like for instance, **data definition** or **data manipulation** statements, possibly leading to file system read and write access and operating system command execution depending on the underlying back-end database management system and the session user privileges.
#### Inline
`--technique=Q`
```bash
Type: inline query
    Title: Microsoft SQL Server/Sybase inline queries
    Payload: id=(SELECT CHAR(58)+CHAR(118)+CHAR(114)+CHAR(100)+CHAR(58)+(SELECT 
(CASE WHEN (6382=6382) THEN CHAR(49) ELSE CHAR(48) END))+CHAR(58)+CHAR(111)+CHAR
(109)+CHAR(113)+CHAR(58))
```
## Syntax that worked
```bash
sqlmap -u "http://alvida-eatery.org/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=get_question&question_id=1" -p 'question_id' -D wordpress -T wp_users --dump --technique=T --flush-session --ignore-code=404 --level=5 --risk=3
```
- `-D`: DBMS to enumerate
- `--flush-session`: flush session files for current target
- `-T`: database tables to enumerate
- `--technique`: SQLi technique to use
