# Cyber Kill Chain
Historically a military concept r/t the structure of an attack. Now the Cyber Killchain Framework, developed by [Lockheed Martin](https://www.lockheedmartin.com), has been established for the cybersecurity industry.

Operates w/ the assumption that the attacker is outside of the target system. *Does not cover insider-threats* or people who use their authorization inside a system to access/ harm a network system.

The Cyber Kill Chain is made up of these phases:
## Reconnaissance
Reconnaissance refers to the collection of information on a target using passive/ stealthy means. The information collected can be done from the outside (before the target has been exploited) *and from the inside* (after you've exploited and gained access).

Recon can describe both *passive* and *active* techniques
- passive: the information is gathered *quietly* without the target knowing
- active: the information is gathered more *aggressively* which may alert the target.

Active techniques can be used to get a better, more accurate profile of the  target *at the risk of alerting them*. These techniques are expected to be done in order.

|Recon Techniques| Type| Techniques Used|
|-|-|-|
|Target ID and selection|passive|DNS, whois records, RIPE, ARIN|
|Target Profiling|||
|a) Social profiling|passive|social networks, public documents, reports, corporate websites|
|b) Target system profiling|active|pingsweeps, fingerprinting, port and service scanning|
|Target Validation|active|SPAM messages, phishing, social engineering|

### [OSINT](/cybersecurity/TTPs/recon/OSINT.md) (outside the target)
OSINT usually refers to the gathering of *open source* intelligence on a target. Open source means the info is *public* so gathering it should not include any illegal activity (passive recon).

There are some gray areas surrounding whether public info has been gathered legally or illegally depending on the means. For example, it's technically legal to do [subdomain enumeration](/cybersecurity/TTPs/subdomain-enumeration.md) if you were to do it by hand. But running a program against the domain which automates enumeration of its subdomains can be considered illegal.

Most attackers perform a lot of [OSINT](/cybersecurity/TTPs/recon/OSINT.md) research into their target in order to discover vulnerabilities, patterns, etc.. Vulnerabilities can be technological or personal/ human in nature (for example: finding a staff member of a target who's public info can be used against them in a [social-engineering](/cybersecurity/TTPs/delivery/social-engineering.md) attack).
#### Examples of OSINT techniques:
- Looking at a target's website and finding what [technologies](/PNPT/PEH/recon/website-tech-recon.md) it uses.
- Looking up a target on google maps
- *Passive* [email harvesting](/PNPT/PEH/recon/email-addresses.md): obtaining email addresses from public/ free services
	1. [The Harvester](recon/tools/credential-harvesting/the-harvester.md) tool which can be used to harvest emails, as well as domains, sub domains, names, IP addresses, URLs etc.
	2. [Hunter.io](https://hunter.io/email-finder)
- Finding who works for a target using LinkedIn, etc.
### Recon *once inside the target/system*
> [!Note]
> This part deviates from the original cyber kill chain.

Recon can also be done once you  have breached the target and have access to the system. After *persistence* has been established, further intelligence should be gathered which can be done quietly.

Especially in [penetration testing](/cybersecurity/pen-testing/penetration-testing.md) the questions once you've breached a system which further recon can answer are:
1. **What can I know** about this target?
2. **What can I do** now that I've breached them?
#### Examples of on-target recon techniques:
- *Groups/Users*: who are you upon entrance? What other groups and users exist? What permissions do they have?
- *Globbing the filesystem*: make a list/map of everything on the system. Get file names, paths, permissions. Find sensitive files which you may want to exfiltrate.
- *Network mapping*: what IP addresses are local? What is the [subnet](/PNPT/PEH/networking/subnetting.md)? What does the [routing table](/networking/routing/routing-table.md) have in it?
- *OS*: what is the CPU architecture? How much memory/RAM is there?
- etc.
## Weaponization
Weaponization refers to the part of the cycle in which the attacker has gathered enough intel to develop:
1. a *Remote Access Tool* (RAT)
2. and an *Exploit*
Using intel gathered during the recon phase, an attacker can now decide what type of weapon will work best for the target. They can also decide on a delivery method, and prepare for difficulties in the installation of their malware as well as defensive measures to avoid.

This stage focuses on *combining software exploits with a remote access tool (RAT)*.
### Remote Access Tool
A RAT is a software which executes on the target's system and gives the attacker remote access. It's also referred to as *the payload* in an attack. Ideally for an attacker, a RAT should be hidden and undetected by the target. 

Access gained via a RAT usually includes:
- system exploration
- file upload/download
- remote file execution
- keylogging
- screen capture
- system or peripheral power on off (ex: webcam)

If the RAT is able to gain administrative/root access, then it can also provide the attacker with network access, spreading, and data capture.
#### RAT: Client
The Client is the software delivered to the target and executes to create a connection from the C2 system to the target. Once connection is established, the Client can execute commands it receives from the controller and sends the results back.

The Client is not always delivered all at once. It can be delivered in separate modules and compiled to the whole on the target.
#### RAT: Server
The Server is the portion of the RAT which runs on the C2 server. This is the vantage point the attacker has to view the target system with and sometimes includes a GUI (of the target system in real time). This is from where the attacker can send commands to the Client portion of the RAT (and receive the results).

Usability of the RAT is a major constraint, so a lot of energy in building a RAT is put towards the server-side UI.
### Exploit
The second part of the Weaponization phase is developing the exploit. The exploit is what carries and delivers the RAT. It uses vulnerabilities in the target software/ system to deliver the RAT.

A major objective of the RAT is to avoid target detection while establishing a backdoor. Once the RAT is installed, persistence, privilege escalation, data exfiltration, spreading, etc. can be achieved by the RAT Client/Server.
### Delivery
How the weapon/payload gets delivered
*Examples*:
1. [watering-hole](/cybersecurity/TTPs/delivery/watering-hole.md)
2. [phishing](/cybersecurity/TTPs/delivery/phishing.md)
3. [candy-drop](/cybersecurity/TTPs/delivery/candy-drop.md)
### Exploitation
When the attacker uses a vulnerability in a device/ system to gain access to the target system.

*Ex of exploits:*
1. a victim triggers the exploit by opening an email attachment/ clicking on a malicious link (phishing)
2. [zero-day](/cybersecurity/TTPs/exploitation/zero-day.md)
3. vulnerabilities in software/ hardware or even human
4. server-based vulnerabilities
### Installation
Once an attacker is in, they need to install something to establish persistence (a way to gain access again)
##### Persistence:
Persistence is the first step once you're on a breached system. You need to be able to:
1. establish a way back in (backdoor)
2. avoid detection
#### [Backdoor](/cybersecurity/TTPs/persistence/backdoor.md)
A backdoor is a way for an attacker to *establish a way back into the system* while bypassing security measures. Can also be called an "access-point". It also allows them to return to exploited targets they compromised in the past.

There are a few ways persistence can be achieved:
##### Installing a [web shell](/cybersecurity/TTPs/exploitation/web-shell.md) on a server
##### Installing a backdoor directly on the victim's machine
An example of this technique is the use of [Metasploit's Meterpreter](exploitation/tools/metasploit.md). Meterpreter is a *payload* which gives the user an interactive shell on *the target's network/device*.
##### Creating or modifying a Windows service
An attacker can create or modify Windows services to execute malicious scripts/ payloads. One way to do this is via *Registry keys* to modify service configurations.

Attackers can also *masquerade a payload* by using service names which are known to be r/t the OS or legitimate software.

They can also add entries to the *run keys* of the malicious payload to the Registry or startup folder. This will cause their payload to *execute each time the user logs into the computer*.
##### Timestamping
Timestamping is a a technique used by attackers to avoid forensic detection. It helps make malware appear legitimate and allows the attacker to modify file timestamps, including when the file was last modified, accessed, created, etc..
### Command and Control ([C2](/cybersecurity/TTPs/C2/C2.md))
This phase describes how attackers maintain remote control/ manipulation of the victim. The compromised victim/ endpoint communicates to an external sever set up by the attacker.

The C2 infrastructure may be owned by the attacker *but also by another compromised host*. Some examples of how C2 can be achieved include:
##### IRC (Internet Relay Chat)
This method used to be common for C2 communication but is now easily detected.
##### [HTTP](/www/HTTP.md) on `port 80` OR [HTTPS](/www/HTTPS.md) on `port 443`
This method is much more common. It allows attackers to blend malicious traffic w/ legitimate traffic, helping them evade [firewalls](/cybersecurity/defense/firewalls.md).
##### [DNS](/networking/DNS/DNS.md)
Attackers can use DNS to set up command and control by purchasing/ registering a *DNS nameserver*. Then, if they can make the victim's machine make DNS requests to the malicious server, they can use that connection to control the rest of their activity on the victim remotely.

This is also known as [DNS Tunneling](/cybersecurity/TTPs/C2/DNS-tunneling.md).
### Actions on Objective:
This part of the cyber kill chain covers all the actions an attacker might take on a victim device once they've exploited it and gained persistent access.

This can include several things like collecting user credentials, [privilege escalation](actions-on-objective/privesc/README.md), lateral movement thru the network, collecting and exfiltrating data, internal recon, deleting backups/ logs/ shadow-copies to *cover their tracks*, overwrite/ corrupt data, etc..
