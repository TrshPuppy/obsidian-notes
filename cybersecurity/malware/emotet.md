# Emotet Malware
A [trojan](/cybersecurity/TTPs/exploitation/trojan.md) commonly used as a downloader or dropper of other malware.
## Technical Details:
Emotet is primarily spread via [phishing](/cybersecurity/TTPs/delivery/phishing.md) email attachments and links. Clicking the link *launches the payload*. Once launched the payload proliferates w/i the network by [brute forcing](/cybersecurity/TTPs/cracking/brute-force.md) user credentials and writing to shared drives.

Emotet is *difficult to combat* due to it's [worm](/cybersecurity/TTPs/actions-on-objective/worm.md)-like features which cause network-wide infection. It also achieves persistence using DLLs (Dynamic Link Libraries) to evolve and update its capabilities.
### Common Brute Forcing Targets:
- password guessing
- local accounts
- [SMB](/networking/protocols/SMB.md) Windows Admin Shares
### Characteristics:
#### Insertion vector: 
Usually inserts via compromised Windows documents attached to phishing emails.
#### Command and Control
Usually is associated w/ C2 network traffic involving [HTTP](/networking/protocols/HTTP.md) `POST` requests consisting of nonsensical, random length, alphabetical directories to known emotet related [domains](/networking/DNS/DNS.md) or [IP addresses](/networking/OSI/IP-addresses.md)
##### `User-Agent` Header:
HTTP traffic from Emotet can sometimes be identified by the following `User-Agent` header:
```
`Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/7.0; SLCC2; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET CLR 3.0.30729; Media Center PC 6.0; .NET4.0C; .NET4.0E; InfoPath.3; .NET CLR`
```
##### Common ports 
Ports commonly used by Emotet for traffic to and from its C2 endpoints include `80`, `8080` and `443`. Port `445` (SMB) is also seen but is less common.
