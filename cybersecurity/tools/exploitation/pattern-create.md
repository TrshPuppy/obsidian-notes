# [Metasploit](cybersecurity/tools/exploitation/metasploit.md) Pattern Create
`pattern_create` is a tool w/i the Metasploit framework which you can use to help find the exact [offset](/PNPT/PEH/buffer-overflows/pattern-create.md) from the saved `EIP`/ `RIP` on the stack of a program to the entrance of a frame you're using to overflow in a [buffer overflow](/cybersecurity/TTPs/exploitation/binary-exploitation/buffer-overflow.md) exploit.
## Purpose
It's not enough to have a general idea of the offset between these two points on the stack. The point of a buffer overflow is to overwrite the saved `EIP` on the stack *at its exact address*.

So, instead of playing a guessing game until we figure out the *exact offset* to the saved `EIP` we can use `pattern_create`. All `pattern_create` does is create a string of patterned segments (instead of a bunch of `A` characters). 

If we use this string buffer in our payload, then when we inspect `EIP` afterwards, we can match the pattern its overwritten with to the string `pattern_create` made and get the exact byte length from that.
## Use
To use `pattern_create` simply navigate to `/usr/share/metasploit-framework/tools/exploit` and execute `./pattern_create.rb` with the `-l` flag.
### `-l` (length)
The `-l` flag is the length we want the string that `pattern_create` makes for us to be. The number we give is *based on the offset we found* using [spiking](/PNPT/PEH/buffer-overflows/spiking.md) and [fuzzing](/PNPT/PEH/buffer-overflows/fuzzing.md).

So, if our offset from fuzzing the vulnerable program was around 3000 bytes, then we execute `pattern_create` like this:
```bash
┌──(hakcypuppy㉿kali)-[~/usr/share/metasploit-framework/tools/exploit] 
└─$ gdb ./pattern_create -l 3000
