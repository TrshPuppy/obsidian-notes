# The Basics of Buffer Overflows
Knowing what we know about [memory](nested-repos/PNPT-study-guide/PEH/buffer-overflows/memory.md), now we can try to understand [buffer-overflow](cybersecurity/TTPs/exploitation/buffer-overflow.md). In general, buffer overflows *target stack frames allocated to data structures being used by a program.* The goal is to overwrite and *overflow* the stack frame in order to access memory not intended to be accessed by that frame.
