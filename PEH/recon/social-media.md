# Using Social Media for OSINT
A lot of open-source/public information can be gathered from browsing social media platforms. For example, visiting the LinkedIn of a target organization can turn up:
- current staff and their credentials (emails, names/ last names)
- images which feature badge photos, technology used, etc.

*People are the weakest point in an organization's security*. Even just having employee names, you can enumerate email addresses. Those addresses can be used to search [breached credentials](nested-repos/PNPT-study-guide/PEH/recon/breached-credentials.md), which can then be used to exploit the target.
